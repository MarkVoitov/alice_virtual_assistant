# alice_virtual_assistant
Small program with virtual assistant functions

Template instance of virtual assistant named Alice (c) Yandex

in this instance Alice's oppotunities are:
- select the answer in accordance with the question in the database;
- answer simple questions (about friends, time and wheather in this example);
- load response from an external web server (http://wttr.in/).

Code was created by me during training on the Python developer program from Yandex.
